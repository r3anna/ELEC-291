# ELEC-291
This repository holds projects that were completed in my Electrical Engineering Design Studio Course. It is currently under the development process as I am currently taking this course. 

The main outcomes of this course is to develop microprocessor or microcontroller applications using Assembly and C programming languages, effectively construct circuits with the knowledge of devices in other courses such as transistors, diodes, and op-amps, and to understand the principles of reflow and through-hole soldering to assemble circuits and systems.
